# Contributing
Contributions are always welcome. To contribute, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo,
commit your changes, and [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) against master.

Pull requests must have unit tests, or if there's some additional browser specifics in the implementation, a Browserstack test is great.
We want to keep the code coverage ah high as possible. 

# Issues
Of course there might be some issues, so if you find one, you're encouraged to fix it, or create an issue in this repo.

# Documentation
If you have a documentation issue or pull request, please open a ticket or a PR. We're also happy to better the docs outside of the readme sections.

# Code quality
Use the lint config attached, and you'll be fine, but to keep things consistent, we'd like to keep:
- file names are all lower-cased in kebab style ( e.g. `live-connect.js`)
- use old school functions on the top level and write as much JS Doc as possible
- one liner functions can use arrow functions
- try to keep the hierarchy as is

Of course, all these might change, we're open to it.
